## About project:
**Restaurant Review Evaluator-NLP tool** created for **Front End Developer Nanodegree** program of **Udacity**.

The main focus put on:
* **Webpack 4** configurations for production and development modes and successful usage of both,
* Getting data from external API (**AYLIEN API**) from the server side,
* User Interface updates in according to the user input and based on that data fetched from the API (server side),
* **Jest** testing for client-side Javascript code,
* Working with **SASS**,
* **Service Workers** required in the project.

## Review evaluation:

The tool takes as an input the feedback of a restaurant customer and with the **Aylien API Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis** evaluates the positive, negative and neutral aspects that were directly or indirectly mentioned.

### Still to be improved/issues:

- [ ] Responsiveness. At the moment the tool is not mobile-screen-friendly.
- [ ] API used in this project will be replaced by another free NLP API for further learning purposes and to make the tool main functionality available.
- [ ] Design.
